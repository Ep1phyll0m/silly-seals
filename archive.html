    <p>artist statement* Waste Water is where water is being used by places such as
    water from warehouses, businesses, corporations, and even homes.
    Also used in toilets, showerheads, sinks that uses the same recycled water
    and that same water goes through a process that removes contaminants such as illnesses,
    germs, and bacteria. Waste water, in a scientific viewpoint, will always be seen to have more
    valuable aspects to it. From these two counties, do have their similarities in terms
    of which contaminants get polluted in the waste water, and therefore determine which
    counties are alerted ahead of time to take certain precautions. By monitoring these diseases, WasteWater
    systems can alert the public ahead of time, to their certain region and area.
   
    This is to be of an informal use to the public, to let them know how the water is being treated
    , how the water is being dealt with, and how the water function in order to figure out what certain
    illnesses come out of it.
