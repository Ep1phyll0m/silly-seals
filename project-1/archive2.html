    <header> <strong> Artist Statement (Quynh's piece) </strong></header>

    <h3> Below this statement is a list of contaminants that have been detected in wastewater processed within the relevant cities listed below. Water is an essential part of life, and studying its properties can give way to significant information regarding our health. In this case, the information shown below is a record of data recorded by 
       <a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/"> WastewaterScan</a>, a company which seeks to spread information about the pathogens present in participating areas. This archive serves to raise awareness of how important the sewer system is to maintaining people’s overall health. With the disclosure of the contaminants found present in the general population’s wastes, there is a hope for attention garnered towards how municipalities choose to go about their funding for its citizens’ wellbeing (especially within the health and waste sectors).</h3>
